# Underground Mining Area Photo Descriptions

## Mine Level: Lobby
Rough hewn rock walls reinforced with rusty steel beams. The elevator shaft goes up. Dust motes dance in the air.

## Mine Level: Work Room
A cluttered workspace. Blueprints scattered on the floor. A heavy desk sits against the wall with a tape recorder on it. A small, pixelated picture hangs on the wall.

## Mine Level: Bunk Room
Cramped living quarters. Triple-stacked bunk beds. A reading lamp flickers over a pile of old magazines.

## Mine Level: Showers
Communal showers. The tiles are cracked and yellowed. Water drips rhythmically.

## Mine Level: Toilets
A row of industrial toilets. The smell is ancient and metallic.

## Stone Crushing Room
Dominated by a massive, silent crushing machine. Conveyor belts sit idle. A dark opening leads to the tunnels.

## Deep Tunnel Entrance
The lights end here. A pitch-black tunnel descends into the crust. You hear strange robotic sounds echoing from the deep.

## Mine Level: Storage
Crates of mining explosives and pickaxes. A massive industrial lever is mounted on the wall. A heavy blast door leads to the crushing room.
